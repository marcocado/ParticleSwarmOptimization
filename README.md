# Particle Swarm Optimization

## Introduction
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based optimization algorithm that is inspired by the collective behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. In PSO, a set of candidate solutions, called particles, move in a multidimensional search space and adjust their positions based on their own experiences and the experiences of their neighboring particles. Each particle has a position and a velocity, and the position represents a possible solution to the optimization problem. The velocity determines the direction and speed of the particle's movement in the search space.
